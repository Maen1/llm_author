       "[{'generated_text': 'what is art, that would be the “universally valid criterion” for separating it from non-art. For this reason Schopenhauer’s theory of value has its own kind of ontological primacy and ought to count more than any empirical criterion in our aesthetic judgments. It seems to me that Fried is not just being playful when he claims that “the Kantian perspective on the question of how we judge works of art is ‘disinterested’.” What Fried means by the aestheticism of modernism (and which we are to understand as a form of anti-aestheticism) is that what matters aesthetically is how a work instantiates a certain normative or axiological category (in this case, the category of anti-theatricality). We can know whether something is an aesthetic object through its instantiation of a particular kind, rather than by trying to understand the subjective reactions it produces in us. The aesthetic quality of a work is determined by its kind. That is why Fried sees the work of art as a self-contained unit, “not because the work is there to be beheld, but precisely because it is not there to be occupied.” 13 Schumpeter, Joseph Schumpeter: A Biography, trans.

      "Because he was so interested in realist effects he often cut up his models in order to present them more effectively. For instance, he often sliced off their hands, because if you don’t see them they look just the same as if they had been the best dressed. Other parts of the body were altered in various ways. His technique is also very distinctive... In fact, you might say that a lot of his compositions are about the relationship between form and matter, or rather about how form relates to what we might call its potential energy. The composition is driven by the forms in a way that makes their form become more important than the bodies themselves. You could even argue that his compositional strategies are less about the content of the painting, the subject, than about the presentation of the subject, although some of his subjects, like David playing with Cupid after the Battle of Schipwa\n"
